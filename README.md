### League of Legends Anti-Toxicity Self Help Mechanism
Blocks enter key from being pressed, with optional beeping when you press enter. Runs as a tray application. Targets .NET Framework (sorry).

There's something about League of Legends and and its special brand of stupid players that annoys me like no other. Since Riot Games won't add an option to unbind the enter key, or an option to automatically mute all players, I made this.

### I have no idea if Riot Games care about messing with keyboard input, use at your own risk.

Uses [gmamaladze's mousekeyhook library](https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook) to block enter key.

Works on other games too I guess.
